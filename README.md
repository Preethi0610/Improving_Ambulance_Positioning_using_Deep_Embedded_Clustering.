# 🚑 Improving Ambulance Positioning Using Deep Embedded Clustering  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to optimize ambulance positioning in response to road accidents using **Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)** and **Cat2Vec**. By leveraging deep learning models, the system predicts optimal ambulance locations, reducing **Estimated Response Time (ERT)** and improving emergency medical services.  

## 🏆 Key Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify accident-prone areas.  
- **Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)** for optimal ambulance positioning.  
- **Cat2Vec embeddings** to preserve spatial relationships in data.  
- **Distance Scoring method** to evaluate model performance.  
- **Continuous learning mechanism** to improve positioning strategies over time.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)  
- **Deep Learning** (Autoencoders, Clustering Algorithms)  
- **SQL** (for dataset management)  
- **Power BI** (for data visualization)  
- **Flask / FastAPI** (for API deployment)  

## 📂 Project Structure  

## 📊 Data Analysis & Model  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:**  
   - Accident datasets are cleaned and preprocessed.  
   - Feature extraction includes **location coordinates, accident severity, and time of occurrence**.  

2. **Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) & Cat2Vec:**  
   - DEC clusters accident locations based on deep representations.  
   - Cat2Vec encodes categorical location data for improved spatial awareness.  

3. **Performance Evaluation:**  
   - **ERT Calculation:** Measures response time improvements.  
   - **Clustering Accuracy:** Compares DEC against other clustering methods.
